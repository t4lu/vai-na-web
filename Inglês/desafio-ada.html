                <h3>Who was Ada Lovelace?</h3>
                <p><b>Augusta Ada King</b> was an English mathematician and writer, chiefly known for her work on
                    Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine. She was the
                    first to recognise that the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, and to have published
                    the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. As a result, she is often regarded
                    as the first computer programmer.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3>Why is she important?</h3>
                <p>Ada Lovelace's notes were labelled alphabetically from A to G. In note G, she describes an algorithm
                    for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. It is considered to be the first published
                    algorithm ever specifically tailored for implementation on a computer, and Ada Lovelace has often
                    been cited as the first computer programmer for this reason.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="paragraph">
                <h3>What is her legacy?</h3>
                <p>

                    Lovelace sadly died at the age of just 32, with her work largely being forgotten in the century to
                    come. It was only in the 1940s that Alan Turing, the father of modern computing, discovered her work
                    and used it as inspiration for his own work in the development of contemporary computing technology.

                    It’s fascinating to think what Ada Lovelace would make of modern computing systems. The advanced
                    capabilities of Neural Technologies’ Optimus platform are far removed from the pioneering vision of
                    the Analytical Engine. Integrating billions of data points in real-time is the result of a technical
                    evolution that would perhaps be unthinkable to those 19th century visionaries. Equally remarkable
                    however is how fundamental similarities with those early machines remain.

                    Over two centuries on, Ada Lovelace’s legacy as the first computer programmer is firmly established.
                    In 1980, the Ada programming language was even named in her honour. But her true legacy, as with
                    those that followed in her footsteps, remains the capabilities and opportunities of our remarkable
                    modern computing landscape.
